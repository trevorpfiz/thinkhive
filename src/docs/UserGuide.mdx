Welcome to ThinkHive!

You can create your very own Assistants using our platform.

Since you are new, you probably donâ€™t have any Assistants, Brains, or files uploaded to your Knowledge Base.

Let's break it down.

Your **Knowledge Base** is a place where you can keep all the files that contain your organization's knowledge. You can upload your files here and manage them so that they are ready to be used in Brains.

**Brains** are where you can organize your files. Think of a Brain as a container that separates your organization's knowledge into different categories.

**Assistants** are chatbots that you can deploy to help your team or customers. You might not want an Assistant to know everything in your Knowledge Base, so you can attach just enough knowledge through Brains to make the Assistant useful, without revealing other sensitive information.

To teach your Assistant, you need to upload files to your Knowledge Base. If you want to update your Knowledge Base easily in the future, split your organization's knowledge into multiple PDF files. This way, if you need to make changes, you only need to upload the updated PDF file instead of the entire Knowledge Base.

Once you upload your files, you'll see them in your Knowledge Base. You can then organize them into Brains, which are like containers that compartmentalize your organization's knowledge. To create a Brain, go to the Brains page and create a new Brain. You can add all the knowledge you want your Assistant to know into one Brain for now.

Once you have a Brain, you can create an Assistant. Give your Assistant a name and then attach the Brain to it. Now your Assistant has knowledge! You can test your Assistant in the Playground or deploy it as a chatbot on your website by embedding it on your website.
